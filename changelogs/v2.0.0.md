The mod is completely overhauled and it now provides a nice GUI as an Encyclopedia page. You can find a list of towns and villages there. For villages, you will be able to see their Primary Production, and their Trade Bound Town. For towns, you will be able to see Workshop Suggestions. The encyclopedia page can also be accessed from town menu.
