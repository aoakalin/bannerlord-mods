Hello World!

Initial release features:

1) Workshop suggestion for every town

When inside a village menu, you will be presented with a menu option -> VARTS Workshop Suggestion (All Towns)

If you click it, a huge JSON data will be printed to the console. Data will be in this format:

{
"TOWN_NAME_1": ["WORKSHOP_NAME1", ..., "WORKSHOP_NAME_N"]
...
"TOWN_NAME_N": ["WORKSHOP_NAME1", ..., "WORKSHOP_NAME_N"]
}

Sometimes, you will see only town name but no workshop names, that means that town is not a good idea to buy a workshop.
